# educake-helper
This is a simple tool used to HELP with educake. By using this tool/script/code, i am hereby not resposible for your actions.
If you are bad at science, revise. I love science, i do well and its fun. But educake seems like a hastle, and it has difficulties so i made this.
Please use responsibly! I am not at fault if you are banned for using this!
To emphasise, only use it if you really need to. I believe that you need to do homework to get that skill in school, but by all means i understand the struggle of "oh this educake is too many questions long oh no!", so thats why i made this tool to HELP students.
If you would like to reach out, make a ticket in the issue section.
